    a pillar to better understand the world around us. Always using my knowledge, experience\
    and imagination to provide solutions, from that my passion for automation and development has grown.\
    In the work environment I always seek improvements for the efficiency and effectiveness\
    of the processes, as for example in the research coordination of the Federal University of Alagoas\
    , where I was part of the team that transformed the processes of the sector, promoting agility and transparency.\
    The thoughts that guide me when starting a new project are to focus on the goals and work as a team.",
